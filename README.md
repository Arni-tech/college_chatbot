## Description

College Chatbot is a question-and-answer retrieval chatbot built on the LangChain framework. Its main objective is to provide answers to general questions about Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology.

This repository includes the necessary training and inference engine files required for the chatbot's operation.

Please note that the frontend interface for the chatbot was not developed by me, and therefore I cannot take credit for it. As a result, the frontend code is not included in this repository.
